*LifeFit* is a Python package to analyze **time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)** data sets, namely **fluorescence lifetime** and **time-resolve anisotropy** data. It fits the decays by iterative reconvolution of a series of exponentials with an experimental or analytical instrument response function (IRF).

### Webserver
*Lifefit* is also available as a [webserver](https://tcspc-lifefit.herokuapp.com/)  (Please note: initial startup may take a few seconds)
